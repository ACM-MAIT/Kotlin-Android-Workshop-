We have complemented 75-85% of the required code to implement the game.  
So following implementations are left to add to in working

- A function to handle the event when a cell with scoreVal==0 is clicked
- Handle onLoss , checkWin methods nicely , disabling user clicks or giving out more than a toast for a message
